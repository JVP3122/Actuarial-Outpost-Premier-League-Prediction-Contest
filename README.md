# Actuarial Outpost Premier League Prediction Contest

This is a very simple program that calculates standings for a prediction contest hosted on Actuarial Outpost.  A group of people entered their predictions for the end of season standings and the person who gets the closest wins the competition.  The format is such that the distance away from the actual place in the table is halved and all 20 distances are added together.  The lowest distance wins.  For example, if someone thinks Manchester United will finish first this season (they are currently third) then they will have an amount of 1 added to their total value.  Tiebreakers are handled in that the tiebreaker winner is the one who has the higher placed team predicted in the final standings.

An illustration of the tiebreaker procedure can be seen in standings.xlsx
